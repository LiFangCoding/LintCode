/**
 * Given some points and an origin point in two-dimensional space, find k points which are nearest to the origin.
 * Return these points sorted by distance, if they are same in distance, sorted by the x-axis, and if they are same in the x-axis, sorted by y-axis.
 *
 * Have you met this question in a real interview?
 * Example
 * Given points = [[4,6],[4,7],[4,4],[2,5],[1,1]], origin = [0, 0], k = 3
 * return [[1,1],[2,5],[4,4]]
